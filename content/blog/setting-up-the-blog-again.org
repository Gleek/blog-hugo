I recently acquired [[https://umarahmad.xyz][umarahmad.xyz]] and move my old blog there.

The earlier version of this blog was based on octopress with a lot of
handcrafted code. The architecture of octopress along with my
excitement of setting up the blog made this a cocktail of all possible
plugins and tweaks that I could manage to squeeze into a static site.
Copy pasted rake snippets and hacked together web and ruby code gave me
what I wanted at the time. I was happy with that.

Although, setting up those bells and whistles was fun, this made it a
nightmare to manage. Since I rarely update the blog, I never actually
remembered how things worked. Every time I wanted to make a change I
had to go through the documentation and the hacks I made again just to
figure out the full system again.

Setting up the domain and blog again gave me an opportunity to
resolve few of these issues.

I wanted something simple and straightforward to manage. I also wanted
to stay in the comfort of Emacs as much as possible and avoid any
extra tooling as much as possible.

Hugo seems to have a simple architecture for me to wrap my head around
and also has good org-mode support.

I might move on to org-publish, later, when that becomes more mature just
to have more control over how things are but for now Hugo seems to
work just fine.

The quick start guide from hugo and [[https://retifrav.github.io/blog/2019/03/17/migrating-from-octopress-to-hugo/][this blogpost]] helped me in
understanding the full process.

I did the full process in Emacs which I’ll cover in another post in
complete detail.

Broadly these are the filtered down steps to reach to that stage.

- *Getting the domain*: [[https://www.namecheap.com/][Namecheap]] seemed like the best option to me,
  costing almost 10% of what other providers did. Domain was activated
  pretty quickly as well.

- *Setting up Cloudflare:* Using cloudflare the DNS can be setup by
  updating the nameservers on the Namecheap dashboard. Alternatively,
  namecheap can point to github pages directly([[https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages/][link]]).

- *Setting up Comment system*: Hugo ships with Disqus but I wanted a
  lighter comment system with less lock-in. [[https://utteranc.es/][Utterances]] provides a way
  for this. They use github issues to manage the comments. One
  drawback is that people will require a github account to post a
  comment. Considering that most of the posts here will be tech
  related. It should cover atleast 80% of the userbase.

I also didn’t want bootstrap with analytics and social media plugins
plaguing the site. I went for the [[https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog][smallest theme]] which suited my
needs, removed few unnecessary styles from it. It’s a Pure HTML and
CSS theme which also makes it ideal for viewing in text based browsers
such as eww

I removed google analytics. I realized that I neither need to know
detailed impressions and click paths nor do I want to ever have ads on
this blog. The adblockers would anyways not let google count the
correct impressions.

The total requests that cloudflare provides along with the path based
analytics with a JS plugin is about the all analytics I’ll ever need
for this blog. I’m unsure if the JS plugin with path based analytics
would add any value. I might remove it later. I just don’t want to
bother removing it now considering their claim to be a privacy
friendly analytics along with only 6KB of extra payload.

I plan on detailing the move from octopress to hugo in a second part
of this blog, but since there are multiple posts about this already
I’m planning to keep that Emacs focused and demonstrate on how I
accomplish similar tasks in emacs.
