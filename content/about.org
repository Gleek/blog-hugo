My name is Umar Ahmad. I work as a software engineer in [[https://www.zomato.com][Zomato]].

I spend most of my time inside Emacs. Discovering and learning something new almost every time I sit down for change in my config.
Hopefully, this blog will contain some of those learnings.

Speaking of config, you can find my [[https://github.com/Gleek/dotfiles][dotfiles]] and my [[https://github.com/Gleek/emacs.d][emacs config]] on github
