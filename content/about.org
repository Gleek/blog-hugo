My name is Umar Ahmad. I'm currently working in [[https://www.zomato.com][Zomato]], a food delivery company and [[https://www.zomato.com/investor-relations][more]], to help it scale to serve millions of customers daily.

This is me in the photo above in the year 2020.

This is my personal blog which I aspire to update regularly with the things I learn mostly around computers and maybe also the other genres of life.

Many of the posts on this blog are about Emacs. This is primarily because a very large portion of my time on a computer is spent inside it.

Like your typical Emacs user, I regularly fall into the rabbit hole of refining my customization to my satisfaction only to be unsatisfied about it in sometime.

This has caused me to spend a significant amount of time customizing it and learning a few things in the process.

Hopefully, this blog will contain some of these learnings.

People interested in the contents of this blog might also be interested in my [[https://github.com/Gleek/emacs.d][emacs config]] and my [[https://github.com/Gleek/dotfiles][dotfiles]]
